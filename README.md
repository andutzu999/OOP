# JAVA OOP 

  All of my projects:
  
  - Passengers boarding a plane: a project based on inheritances and polymorphism;             
  - Smart thermostat: a project in which I mostly used arraylists in sorting custom objects by various fields;                   
  - Intelligent competitions(Design Patterns): In this project, 
  I used all important design patterns(Singleton, Factory, Observer etc.) -> code more flexible, reusable and maintainable.
